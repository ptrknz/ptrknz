- 👋 Hi, I’m @ptrknz and I'm from germany
- 👀 I’m interested in hardware and software development, energy management, HVAC, Industrial applications and a thousend other things
- 🌱 I'm a mechatronic technican working in the industry for some years, I'm mostly a hardware guy but I can do sotware too, I mean most modern hardware come with some kind of software necessity so we are all forced to do some sotware
- 💞️ I’m looking to document some of my projects on Github, maybe helping some random internet stranger with anything
- 💰 I'm open for comissions, I build everything if you pay me enought
- 📫 How to reach me ? You will find a way. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a huge Futurama fan.
